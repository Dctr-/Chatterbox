## Introduction

Chatterbox is an open-source social media web app built out of curiousity. It's still heavily in development, but the barebones are there including login/register pages, role based authentication back end, and a simple dashboard.

## Stack

Chatterbox is a one page web app built ontop of PHP, SQLite, Javascript, and NGINX. At its core it also leverages the Laravel (PHP) and Vue.JS (Javascript) frameworks and runs inside a Vagrant virtual machine.
